## About the Project

**HelpStream** is a decentralized Web3 platform designed to empower individuals and organizations to create fundraising events or campaigns for personal, charitable, or community-driven causes.
Users can create or contribute to helpstreams, track progress in real-time, and ensure that funds are distributed fairly and without intermediaries.

### Objectives

- To offer a secure and transparent platform for raising and managing funds through blockchain technology.
- To facilitate the creation and contribution to various helpstreams, supporting individuals, charities, or community-driven projects.
- To ensure that donors can track their contributions and the progress of helpstreams in real-time.

### Scope

_Helpstream Creation:_ Users can create helpstreams with custom descriptions, funding goals, and project details. This feature is designed to cater to a wide range of use cases such as personal needs, charity campaigns, or community efforts.

_Contributions and Funding:_ Supporters can fund helpstreams directly using cUSD, ensuring that all transactions are securely recorded on the blockchain.

_Transparency and Security:_ The blockchain-backed architecture ensures all transactions are transparent, secure, and immutable. Donors can trace exactly where their contributions are going and the progress of each helpstream.

_Real-time Monitoring:_ Users and donors can view live updates on the funds raised, contributors, and overall progress towards the helpstream goal.
